# XF16Cam functionality

Every capability exposed by the firmware, and whether it is reachable from the
web console, the HTTP API, or both. Derived from the code on this branch
(`project/example/xf16cam/xf16cam_http.c`, `xf16cam_board.c`, `command.c`), not
from `readme.md` — the readme was last updated at `aaa71ca` and predates the
multi-client, day/night, and stall-recovery work.

## How the page gets its data

Almost everything is **server-rendered into `GET /`** as C string literals: LED
button labels, SD capacity, and the whole System tab are a snapshot taken when
the page is built, and they stay frozen until you reload. The page itself never
polls for them — `GET /api/system` returns the same diagnostics as JSON, but it
exists for external clients and nothing in the UI calls it.

Only four things change without a reload:

| What | Trigger | Request |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mic peak level | Automatic, every 2 s while the Live tab is visible | `GET /api/audio` |
| Wi-Fi scan list | "Scan networks" button | `GET /api/scan` |
| Battery voltage | "Measure voltage" button | `POST /api/power` |
| LED button labels | The toggle itself, relabelled from the POST response | `POST /api/led`, `/api/ir_led` |

`GET /api/led` and `GET /api/ir_led` are **not used by the page at all** — the
UI shows LED state through the server-rendered button label ("Turn LED off"
means it is currently on). Those two endpoints exist only for external clients.

## Features

Legend: OK = supported, "-" = not exposed there.
UI = visible or actionable in the web console. API = has a dedicated endpoint.
Variant: *PTZ* = PTZ boards only, *NO_PTZ* = fixed-camera boards only, blank = both.

| Toggle IR LED | OK | OK | `POST /api/ir_led` | PTZ | Also switches SP0A39 to night/mono; auto day/night may revert it within 5 s |
| Automatic day/night switching | - | - | CDS light sensor, ADC5 | PTZ | Every 5 s; avg of 10 samples > 1500 = dark, drives IR LED + sensor night mode |
| PTZ move / home | OK | OK | `POST /api/ptz` | PTZ | `mode=up\|down\|left\|right\|home`; 501 under NO_PTZ |
| PTZ idle power-down | - | - | automatic | PTZ | Motors powered down 10 s after the last move |

| Hibernate | OK | OK | `POST /api/hibernate` | NO_PTZ | Wakes on PA20; quiesces media first; PTZ builds have no route or button (404) |
| Mount / check SD card | OK | OK | `POST /api/sd/refresh` | | 503 when no readable FAT card |
| Safely eject SD card | OK | OK | `POST /api/sd/eject` | | Releases the shared PA23 rail |
| Format SD card (FAT32) | OK | OK | `POST /api/sd/format` | | Destructive |
| SD capacity / mount status | OK | OK | Storage tab, `/api/system` | | Mounted flag, total and free MiB |
| Firmware update (OTA) | OK | OK | `POST /api/ota` | | Streamed, verified before the bootloader selects it |
| Reboot | OK | OK | `POST /api/reboot` | | System tab Power card; 409 while an update holds the lock |
| All diagnostics as JSON | - | OK | `GET /api/system` | | Everything below in one response; streamed, no Content-Length |
| Device info | OK | OK | System tab, `/api/system` | | Flash JEDEC/size, MAC, network mode, IP, heap |
| DHCP hostname | OK | OK | System tab, `/api/system` (`host`) | | `XF16CAM-<last 3 MAC bytes>`, derived from the eFuse MAC; read-only, sent as DHCP option 12 in STA mode |
| Runtime info | OK | OK | System tab, `/api/system` | | Uptime, boot reason, chip temperature (tenths degC, `null` if unavailable) |
| Stack diagnostics | OK | OK | System tab, `/api/system` | | Min spare stack for HTTP, audio, board workers |
| Media counters | OK | OK | Live tab, `/api/system` | | Frames, largest JPEG, capture errors, capacity, last-frame age, client count |
| Pin map | OK | - | System tab | | Confirmed XF16 assignments, varies by variant |

| Capture-stall recovery | - | - | automatic | | Reboots if a session holds the camera and no frame for 30 s, counted from the camera being acquired |
| Mode button (Web/RTSP toggle) | - | - | PA15 short press | NO_PTZ | Physical control |
| Setup/reset to AP | - | - | PA20 / PB19 hold 3 s | | Physical control; PA20 on NO_PTZ, PB19 on PTZ |
| Status / illumination LED | - | - | PA21 / PB20 | | NO_PTZ: blinks on boot, solid when ready. PTZ: off when ready |

## Serial console

Recovery path over PB0/PB1, kept working independently of media, storage, and
configuration state. Replies are `<ACK> <code> <text>`.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `wifi ap` | Save open-AP mode and reboot |
| `wifi sta <ssid> <password>` | Save station credentials and reboot; password never echoed |
| `upgrade` | Unconditional BootROM handoff for UART reflashing |

## Client limits

Three parallel clients per media type (`XF16CAM_MAX_PARALLEL_CLIENTS`), each on
its own thread, with a 4th getting `503`. In **AP mode the DHCP pool is a single
lease**, so only one device can associate at a time regardless of that limit.
A single capture lock serializes frame acquisition, so one slow client cannot
observe a buffer another client is still reading.
